# Android apps portfolio
Android App to show portfolio of apps created for UDACITY nanodegree
This app is intended to be integrated with other applications made by me so people interested could access quickly and easy to my work in motion.

On branch "calabash_tests" you will find a basic configuration for calaba.sh functional tests and a CI flow configuration for Bitrise.
